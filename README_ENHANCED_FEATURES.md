# Enhanced Tracking Features

This document explains the new enhanced features that have been added to improve the accuracy and functionality of the tracking system.

## Improved Person Recognition Accuracy

The person recognition system has been enhanced to prevent misidentification issues:

### Key Improvements
1. **Stricter Matching Thresholds**: Reduced `MATCH_THRESHOLD` from 0.55 to 0.45 for more accurate matching
2. **Weighted Distance Calculations**: People with more face samples get slight bonuses, while those with fewer get penalties
3. **Stricter Duplicate Detection**: Reduced duplicate encoding threshold from 0.3 to 0.2

### Configuration
These improvements are controlled through `config.py`:
```python
MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.45       # Face recognition match threshold (lower = stricter)
CANDIDATE_THRESHOLD = 0.4    # Threshold for considering as candidate (stricter than match)
```

## Periodic Emotion Logging

The system now logs emotion information every 5 seconds with clear, readable messages.

### Example Output
```
ðŸ˜Š Person ID 1 is happy (confidence: 0.85)
ðŸ˜Š Agne is neutral (confidence: 0.74)
```

### Configuration
The emotion logging interval can be configured in `config.py`:
```python
PLUGIN_CONFIG = {
    'emotion_logger_enabled': True,
    'emotion_logger_interval': 5000,  # milliseconds (5 seconds)
}
```

## Data Cleanup

If you're experiencing persistent recognition issues, you can clean up person data:

```bash
python -m uv_app.cleanup_person_data
```

This will remove all stored person data and allow the system to rebuild clean profiles.

## API Emotion Integration

The system integrates with your emotion detection API service and displays emotions near face bounding boxes in the UI.

### API Response Format
The system properly parses the emotion API response:
```json
{
  "faces": [
    {
      "box": null,
      "scores": {
        "neutral": 0.7448026537895203,
        "happiness": 0.02442147023975849,
        "surprise": 0.009107688441872597,
        "sadness": 0.21152910590171814,
        "anger": 0.007830388844013214,
        "disgust": 0.0004626452282536775,
        "fear": 0.0008954873774200678,
        "contempt": 0.00095049396622926
      },
      "top_emotion": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting Recognition Issues

If the system is still misidentifying people:

1. **Clean up person data**: Run the cleanup script to remove problematic profiles
2. **Ensure good lighting**: Face recognition works best with well-lit faces
3. **Position faces clearly**: Make sure faces are clearly visible and not obstructed
4. **Allow time for profiling**: The system needs multiple samples to build accurate profiles

The enhanced system should now provide much more accurate person recognition and reliable emotion detection.
